He is responsible for some of the most influential albums of all time, such as <em>The Freewheelin&#8217; Bob Dylan</em>, <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em>, <em>Blood on the Tracks</em> and <em>Blonde on Blonde</em>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/74ASZWbe4lXaubB36ztrGX?si=DQ79TfCvSZ6LJBU33UmLwA\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>He has pioneered several types of songwriting (from confessional singer-songwriter to winding, hallucinatory, stream-of-consciousness narratives and &#8211; not least &#8211; <em>electric </em>folk rock) and influenced countless musicians throughout the decades, including The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchel and Neil Young.</p>\n<p>The musical icon has experienced it all: His early songs became anthems for the Civil Rights Movement and anti-war movement, music magazine Rolling Stone has chosen &#8220;Like a Rolling Stone&#8221; as the best song <em>ever</em>, he is recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he has won the Nobel Prize in Literature and he has been called the Messiah (and Judas (!) &#8211; for electrifying his folk songs!) by his audience.</p>\n<p>For more than a half century, Bob Dylan has challenged and spellbound generations of music lovers on a musical odyssey, and he has always gone against any kind of cultural and artistic categorisation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"IwOfCgkyEj0\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1801/bob-dylan-video.png\" data-res=\"1264,650\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1801/bob-dylan-video.png?width=1264&amp;height=1264&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>Bob Dylan isn&#8217;t like many iconic artists: he never will &#8211; and infamously never has &#8211; pandered to expectations of audience or to nostalgia. When performing on <em>The</em> <em>Never Ending Tour</em>, Bob Dylan reimagines and contemporises his back catalogue full of classics. When the 77-year-old artist takes place behind his piano he is surrounded by a stellar band (aptly called <em>his band</em>) consisting of drummer George Receli, six-stringer Charlie Sexton, bass player Tony Garnier and string man Donnie Herron. And judging by recent set lists (Rolling Stone has <span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-dylan-2018-set-list-live-716633/\">done some digging</a></span>), we may just be treated to some true gems.</p>\n<p>Seeing Bob Dylan in concert is a bucket list thing for most music fans. This summer, you can check (or double/triple/quadruple etc.) yours when Bob Dylan returns to Roskilde Festival, his sixth visit here and the first since 2006.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

And she&#8217;s turning heads and turning pop trends upside down with her music.</p>\n<p>Rosal&#237;a&#8217;s music is rooted in flamenco, which she has studied since a young age, and has found just the right way to situate her classical training alongside Justin Timberlake and Arthur Russell samples, glossy synths and hip-hop swing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/7ltDVBr6mKbRvohxheJ9h1?si=qxE2TSSBTcybu47Uajs1kw\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>She does not rip the flamenco rule book up, but definitely adds new chapters&#8230;</p>\n<p>The rhythm tracks are decorated with flamenco palmas and the arrangements are minimal wisps of electronics and bass, with Rosal&#237;a&#8217;s vocals front and centre.</p>\n<p>She is, of course, a big star in her mother country, and she&#8217;s conquering new territory for each passing day, including the US and Europe.</p>\n<p>Her first album (<em>Los &#193;ngeles </em>from 2017) was full of reworks of flamenco classics, and it made Rosal&#237;a a name to watch out for. The following year she released the stunning <em>El Mal Querer</em> (translates to &#8216;a bad desire&#8217;).

She perfectly transitions from choreo-driven moments to vocal acrobatics without stopping for a breath. Audiences are often witnessed being completely silent when Rosal&#237;a sings, in awe of her immense and intimate expression.</p>\n<p>So, start taking those language courses and be ready for some flamenco-flavoured pop music when Rosal&#237;a plays Roskilde Festival 2019.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

The new wave synth-pop of their hugely influential 1983 debut album <em>The Hurting</em> led to the pop gloss of 1985&#8217;s <em>Songs from the Big Chair</em> and 1989&#8217;s grandiose <em>Seeds of Love</em>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4bthk9UfsYUYdcFyqxmSUU?si=ExuHVUiHRbacfWk7kCiT2Q\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>The group also made a glorious comeback album in 2005 with <em>Everybody Loves a Happy Ending</em> (the duo&#8217;s first together in 15 years after Orzabal had run the band solo in the course of three albums), which references both Beatles and Bacharach with its sophisticated arrangements.</p>\n<p>Want singles? You got it. &#8220;Shout&#8221;, &#8220;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&#8221;, &#8220;Sowing the Seeds of Love&#8221;, &#8220;Head Over Heels&#8221;, &#8220;Mad World&#8221;... There&#8217;s plenty to choose from.</p>\n<p>Tears for Fears have sold over 30 million albums worldwide, and they have climbed to the top spot of the charts again and again, on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"Ye7FKc1JQe4\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1385/tears_thumbnail.png\" data-res=\"3354,1804\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1385/tears_thumbnail.png?width=2048&amp;height=2048&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>You can hear Tears for Fears&#8217; influence everywhere these days. It&#8217;s in The 1975&#8217;s sheen and groove, in Arcade Fire&#8217;s synth obsessions and electronic flourishes, and in&#160;Lorde&#8217;s (she covered &#8220;Everybody Wants to Rule the World) space and textures. Nu-metal band Disturbed covered &#8220;Shout&#8221;, and the genre-busting film &#8220;Donnie Darko&#8221; made a huge hit out of Gary Jules and Michael Andrews&#8217; take on &#8220;Mad World&#8221;. Tears for Fears have been lurking in the shadows, even when they haven&#8217;t been active.</p>\n<p>The band has harvested great reviews for the latest concert tours. They played in Royal Albert Hall in 2017, and their setlists deliver non-stop hits throughout the concert. They turn their original tracks into contemporised tunes that resonate just as deeply with the young generation as generation who were young when the tunes were first released. Backed by a three-piece band, Tears for Fears still sound amazing, and Orzabal and Smith&#8217;s vocals sound just as emotional as they did in the 80s. The band is reportedly working on a brand-new album as well, so we may even be treated with some sparklingly new tunes when they visit Roskilde Festival 2019.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

With its dark aesthetics, heavy songs and fast tempos, this brand of electronic music has quickly conquered the hearts of both ravers and metalheads.</p>\n<p>The genre evokes the hallmarks of 70s and 80s horror and sci-fi film scores but often with a little more pop sensibility and a fatter, louder production. Franck Hueso, better known by his stage name Carpenter Brut, is at the forefront of this ever-expanding, nostalgia-tinged movement. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1l2oLiukA9i5jEtIyNWIEP?si=l4sM98OmT_SiWIz0XZxXsw\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>The synth-waver released three stunning EPs between 2012 and 2015, which have been compiled on the release <em>Trilogy</em>.

The sound is an encapsulation of what Franck Hueso describes as a &#8220;pure frenzy like <em>Master of Puppets</em>, or any of the good old metal albums: eight tracks wrapped in 32 minutes of sound.&#8221; It&#8217;s not thrash metal but it bridges some energy from the hard-hitting genre.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"er416Ad3R1g\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1662/carpenterbrut_video.jpg\" data-res=\"1280,720\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1662/carpenterbrut_video.jpg?width=1280&amp;height=1280&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>Franck Hueso primarily works as a one-man army in the studio.

Together they deliver shredding guitars, thundering drums and one thick, dirty synth line after another. Expect mosh pits, aggression, nostalgia and dance &#8211; and expect to be enchanted when Carpenter Brut plays like its 1985 all over again!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

The 29-year-old rapper shows himself as an incredibly versatile vocalist. He lets his voice range from a mellow flow to raspy shouting.

We&#8217;re doing it with a musical figure who is cocky, confident and confrontational.</p>\n<p>Her name is Silvana Imam, and she is Sweden&#8217;s perhaps strongest voice right now in hip-hop. The 32-year-old rapper has a way with words. She&#8217;s an innovator of language with a natural authority and stylistic self-confidence. She speaks to everybody who doesn&#8217;t quite fit in.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/14vNE9iqS5eGAL6OogiN8g?si=sDilQW11Th-ShAdvJfx8rA\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>When she steps onto a stage, she owns it. She paces from side to side, sometimes she races out among the crowds while spitting her lyrics into the microphone, about toppling the patriarchy, about fighting racists and about defending the rights of homosexuals.</p>\n<p>When she first broke through as a strong voice in Swedish hip-hop, Silvana Imam was designated as a beacon, a role model. As a rapper, an immigrant and a lesbian, she broke new ground. Anthems like <span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlM73nVkM7k\">&#8220;T&#228;nd alla ljus&#8221;</a></span>, &#8220;Sv&#228;r p&#229; min mamma&#8221; and &#8220;F&#246;r evigt&#8221; (among many more) are all solid proof that Silvana Imam is a master at combining serious messages and catchy hooklines. She refers to herself as a natural force (&#8216;naturkraft&#8217;, which is also the name of her 2016 album and her own label) &#8211; and that&#8217;s exactly what she is.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"zlM73nVkM7k\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1912/silvana-video.jpg\" data-res=\"1280,720\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1912/silvana-video.jpg?width=1280&amp;height=1280&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>One <span><a href=\"https://www.kultursidan.nu/?p=37482\">review</a></span> mentions that Silvana Imam is bigger than her music, that she brings forth a message that arouses hope for freedom and better values.</p>\n<p>Silvana Imam has reaped lots of stat-studded reviews and rewards in recent years, including &#8216;best lyricist&#8217; (Musikf&#246;rl&#228;ggarnas Pris), &#8216;best live act&#8217; (P3 Gold and Manifestgalan) and various Swedish <em>Grammis</em>.</p>\n<p>A new chapter has started now.</p>\n<p>Silvana Imam&#8217;s third album <em>Helig moder </em>came out in February, and now she&#8217;s ready to update her list of Roskilde gigs: from the stage for upcoming talent, Countdown, in 2015 over Apollo in 2016 and now, in 2019, she&#8217;s ready for the biggest stage, Orange Stage.</p>\n<p>The Swedish rapper is preparing a very special show.

The English singer's recent output is a haunting blend of world music, psychedelic folk and American blues, something of a natural extension of a path&#160;he's been exploring since the early 70s.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"AwPj8AJqVqQ\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1806/robert-plant-video.png\" data-res=\"1272,535\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1806/robert-plant-video.png?width=1272&amp;height=1272&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>It can all be boiled down to rhythm and blues &#8211; the separate entities, not the genre &#8211; when it comes to the sound and feel of Plant and his band, The Sensational Space Shifters, who have written and played with him in various guises for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>Robert Plant turned 70 in 2018 &#8211; but trust us on this one: on stage he still has all the magnetic charisma and presence that made him the front man of the band that more or less created rock music as we know it.

The tracks showcased their impressive ability to channel youthful exuberance and blue-sky thinking into refined, hook-heavy hip-hop tracks.</p>\n<p>In 2018, they released<span>&#160;</span><em>iridescence</em>, which made its debut at the top spot of the US Billboard album chart. All critics agree that it delivers on the steadily evolving promise of the&#160;<em>Saturation</em>&#160;series with thoughtful introspection and their typically genre-blurring sound fusion.

They have released <span><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/barselonaband\">three mixtapes</a></span> (from 2016), two EPs and a handful of music videos, and it seems that their musical curiosity and gilt-edged source of inspiration are inexhaustible.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2wdsck730u8ZhDA7eVHw7m?si=zCnzY1zpRBqZ0gyFa8y1Kw\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>After first having formed a band (a decision made at Roskilde Festival) the two friends, Rasmus Theodor and Rud Aslak, quickly found an expression that was their own. Their appreciation of DIY culture and pop music in pastel colours led to a skewed lo-fi expression with hooky songs. The EPs <em>Drengepop </em>and <em>Sommerkys </em>were about endless blue skies and the euphoria (and sadness) of youth. No ironic distance here, just great fervour.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"kXiMvyyF6_g\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1660/barselona_video.jpg\" data-res=\"1280,720\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1660/barselona_video.jpg?width=1280&amp;height=1280&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>And that&#8217;s what works with Barselona. They mean it, maaan! And people love them! When they played at Roskilde 2017 on our Rising stage, the area was full of people dancing along to their music. In concert, the duo expands to a five-piece band who wants to rock out a bit more. Thick bass, drums, glimmer synths, guitar chords in minor and, of course, Rud Aslak&#8217;s lazy, shrewd croon on top of it all.</p>\n<p>Now, Barselona is gearing up for new things. The single &#8220;Fra Wien til Rom&#8221; puts some clouds on the blue sky, and a more grey-ish melancholy pushes the song, and the band, towards new territories. A catchy whistle hook lets the song spin forever inside your head. And the latest single, &#8220;Har v&#230;ret p&#229; vingerne&#8221;, is an acoustic song showing a new brand of sparse fervour. Thye are teasers for a full length that the world &#8211; or Denmark, at least &#8211; is waiting for. The band has promised a more rocking, organic sound. Exciting times are ahead, and in the meantime the crowds at Barselona shows only grow bigger.</p>\n<p>The idea of Barselona started at Roskilde. The story will continue here.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

It&#8217;s full of the suspenseful, banging techno he's been known for since the early beginnings. Blawan remains a master of controlling tension and pushes things forward by showing that the traditional techno template can still be sculpted in surprising new forms with his own trademark sound. No wonder he&#8217;s won over the critics (just have a peek at this review from <span><a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22753\">Resident Advisor</a></span>).</p>\n<p>When he takes the stage at Roskilde Festival he will play a live modular set.

On Diawara&#8217;s first album, the musicians included&#160;renowned Malian kora player Toumani Diabat&#233; &#8211; and on her latest release the cast includes his son Sidiki Diabat&#233; (also playing the kora, of course) as well as French star guitarist Matthieu Chedid and French cellist Vincent S&#233;gal.</p>\n<p>36-year-old Fatoumata Diawara mostly sings in Bambara (the language and name of the largest ethnic group in Mali), and she tackles everything from migration to African identity and demands to end the ban on marriages between different ethnic groups. Many of her songs are also about female empowerment, calling for more female leaders on the African continent. In the wake of the discovery of slave markets in Libya, she has also recorded a powerful anti-racism song, &#8220;Djonya&#8221; (<span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_0BMw4_pw0\">listen here</a></span>).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"ZbMh_ODIW-E\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1663/fatoumatadiawara_video.jpg\" data-res=\"1598,819\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1663/fatoumatadiawara_video.jpg?width=1598&amp;height=1598&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>Tall and sculptural, Fatoumata Diawara is a majestic presence on a live stage.

She sings about abortion, refugees, gun violence and the ease with which conspiracy calcifies into assumed fact these days. It feels like delving into Cherry&#8217;s personal thoughts on the world and how they directly affect her. She proves that she&#8217;s one of our most vital and interesting voices around.</p>\n<p>Neneh Cherry has charisma, stage presence and a big back catalogue to pick from, so expect nothing less than a musical force at play (hitting it both soft and hard) when Neneh Cherry revisits Roskilde Festival.

They occasionally play with the ferocity of the punks of yesteryear, and singer/guitarist Andrew Savage sings with the literate posturing of Colin Newman (Wire) or PiL-era John Lydon, but the roots of what Parquet Courts does best are found in their attempts to marry pseudo-intellectual rambling with a sound that&#8217;s as indebted to classic rock and early art-rock as it is to punk and its offspring.</p>\n<p>With three incredible \"proper\" records under their belt and a handful of off-shoot releases, it seems kind of amazing that the songwriting team of Andrew Savage and Austin Brown (backed by Andrew's brother Max on drums and Sean Yeaton on bass) have been able to not only consistently produce some of the finest indie rock of the decade, but somehow keep topping themselves with every release. They grow more popular, naturally, but thankfully the DIY quartet haven&#8217;t sanded off any of their spikier corners.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"jHfOqqQ1DLQ\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1402/parquetcourts_thumbnail.png\" data-res=\"3360,1858\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1402/parquetcourts_thumbnail.png?width=2048&amp;height=2048&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>For their latest album, <em>Wide Awake!</em>, the band enlisted Danger Mouse (yes, <em>that </em>Danger Mouse) as a producer.

Danger Mouse just let the fellows do their thing.

It&#8217;s a call for change.</p>\n<p>Few bands know how to express the aesthetics of noise in a tonic language as exquisitely as this Copenhagen-based four piece.

It shrouds you like a soft-yet-hard-edged pillow. Intuitive rock forces are at work, and they function on special frequencies that will stun you.

It&#8217;s fair to say that Robyn has been the soundtrack to many heartbreaks.</p>\n<p>When Robyn plays Roskilde Festival 2019 she will break hearts and make us all dance at the very same time. She will take our Orange Stage for a late-night bash. With a stellar backing band, touching choreographies and a setlist packed with hits (both bangers and ballads), Robyn is ready to make her night back at Roskilde Festival one to remember. She has been here two times before, 2008 and 2010 (and 2009 as a guest at R&#246;yksopp&#8217;s gig). She returns stronger, bigger, better, and there&#8217;s no doubt that 2019 will give us something majestic.</p>\n<p>Remember the pose: Eyes closed, fists clenched and body swaying &#8211; that&#8217;s the correct physical reaction to Robyn songs. It&#8217;s cathartic and empowering stuff for anyone. And trust us &#8211; in front of Orange Stage no one will be dancing on their own!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

With Spiritualized, Jason Pierce stepped forward as a bandleader and wrapped clearer song structures around his sonic maelstroms and many-coloured songs.</p>\n<p>While they can hark back to rockabilly, soul, country, garage rock and gospel, Spiritualized songs always have their own uprooted, unmoored tone.&#160;And Pierce&#8217;s voice has always been fragile and telling, in songs that contemplate pain, confusion, loneliness, estrangement and uncertain hope.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"4vNrHoLS1zc\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1384/spiritualized_thumnail.png\" data-res=\"3360,1814\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1384/spiritualized_thumnail.png?width=2048&amp;height=2048&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>In 2018 Spiritualized, which is now just Jason Pierce alone, released its eighth album, <em>And Nothing Hurt</em>, to great critical acclaim (that often happens!). It hails from the same blissed-out space-rock territory and layered arrangements as the &#8216;97 masterpiece&#160;<em>Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space</em>.</p>\n<p>Pierce expertly builds hypnotic layers of swirling, siren-like instrumentation and chiming bells summoning the sounds of the galaxy. Other times he blends gospel and garage rock to just as great delight.</p>\n<p>When all of this translates to a live stage, we&#8217;re really in for a treat. Pierce has a certain command of musical texture. He directs his band perfectly through many moods, from tortured intimacy to scorched-earth bluesy riffings to gospel-tinged psychedelia and the occasional noiseballs shaking the snowglobe world that is Spiritualized. It&#8217;s a like a cosmic journey into space. Just be careful you don&#8217;t orbit out there.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

This says a lot about the popularity surrounding a band that started playing post-punk in the London suburb of Crawley before moving onwards to an infectious mix of haunting melancholy and off-kilter pop. Through the years they have produced more than 30 critical singles, including ear worms like &#8220;The Lovecats&#8221;, &#8220;Close To Me&#8221;, &#8220;Just Like Heaven&#8221;, &#8220;Lullaby&#8221; and &#8220;Friday I&#8217;m in Love&#8221;. Among their 13 studio albums they have created dark masterpieces that remain on various &#8216;best ever&#8217; lists, including Pornography, Disintegration and Bloodflowers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"02U-jmVMVFs\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1376/the_cure_thumbnail.png\" data-res=\"3210,1748\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1376/the_cure_thumbnail.png?width=2048&amp;height=2048&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>When the Cure first played live in Denmark, they played at Roskilde Festival.

This makes Roskilde Festival a true homefield for the English band.</p>\n<p>The Cure has always put on marvellous shows that resonate with thousands of Roskilde-goers. And once they start playing they don&#8217;t stop anytime soon. Their setlists are always immense.</p>\n<p>Seeing the Cure live is much more than a celebration of their legacy. You sense that you&#8217;re witnessing that rare feat of a decades-old band perhaps entering their prime rather than their twilight years.&#160;On their 1982 track &#8220;Pornography&#8221; Robert Smith sings: &#8220;I must fight this sickness, find a cure&#8221;.

She has wowed critics in roles in Academy-nominated films, &#8221;Moonlight&#8221; and &#8220;Hidden Figures&#8221;, so performing a character is natural stuff for this prodigy!</p>\n<p>In 2018, when&#160;the 33-year-old artist&#160;released the critically acclaimed <em>Dirty Computer</em>, her third album, she staked her claim to be the year&#8217;s most vital pop star (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/feature/critics-pick-top-10-best-albums-of-2018\">try counting just how many end of year lists this album has topped</a>).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/6ueGR6SWhUJfvEhqkvMsVs?si=xQg8QD2SR32S2V7f4ZYofA\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>The album challenges social norms and traditional concepts of a woman's role in the world.

He pulls every disorienting trick out of the carpet bag: sitar, oud, sub bass, trumpeting pachyderms and dubby contributions by&#160;psych outrider Gonjasufi.</p>\n<p>A trippy invitation which adds a new exciting chapter to a group who has already delivered drowsy party bangers like &#8220;Insane in the Brain&#8221;, &#8220;I Ain&#8217;t Going Out Like That&#8221;, &#8220;Hits from the Bong&#8221;, &#8220;(Rock) Superstar&#8221;, &#8220;Dr. Greenthumb&#8221;, &#8220;How I Could Just Kill a Man&#8221; and &#8220;I Wanna Get High&#8221;.</p>\n<p>When Cypress Hill returns to Roskilde Festival (they were here last in 1996), you can expect lots of booming bass and thumping beats to get your head rocking. The group&#8217;s sound is instantly recognisable, with the high and nasal voices whining through raps and rhymes. Cypress Hill will send you off to the hot and hazy cities of California, with a mix of heavy bass and psychedelic elements.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Catfish and The Bottlemen&#8217;s 2019 new album release follows 2014&#8217;s platinum-certified debut, The Balcony and 2016&#8217;s gold, number one follow-up, The Ride. Companion to the release of their third album is the anticipation, if not vocal impatience, of their waiting fans and the knowledge within the band that it represents a likely escalation of the successes of the last three years.</p>\n<p>Practically of no fixed abode, the band has toured constantly since their formation, now over a decade ago. Hotel rooms, tour buses, airport lounges and live venues are home, with the band&#8217;s roots seemingly indeterminable.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2xaAOVImG2O6lURwqperlD?si=h4F5wuBDT1qabwGKgUIVgA\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>McCann is extensively quoted saying that his band&#8217;s isolation in the fast lane of emotive, youthful alternative rock is thanks to their conscious plot to <em>&#8216;think inside the box&#8217;</em>. While typical chaos swirls around an in-demand, arena-filling rock band, that uncharacteristically strategic starting point for the journey remains their pivot. When judged fairly from distance, Catfish and The Bottlemen are a natural reaction to an age of perpetual identity-crises, fruitless cravings for elusive individuality and the &#8216;curation&#8217; of everything from shoes to breakfast cereals. They&#8217;ve proved that simplicity isn&#8217;t, as it turns out, a sin or the safest route to take.</p>\n<p>Freed from opinion and expectation, young music fans flock in their tens of thousands to see and hear the band in concert, exercising joyful release, in communion, as the rest of the world appears to fight with itself on the outside.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"XUd2S8a2ChQ\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/2028/catfish-and-the-bottlemen-video.jpg\" data-res=\"1280,720\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/2028/catfish-and-the-bottlemen-video.jpg?width=1280&amp;height=1280&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>The first snapshot of a new album, <em>&#8216;Fluctuate&#8217;</em>, performed throughout summer 2018, teased out a lean, refreshed version of everything Catfish fans find so easy so to love. McCann performed what sounded like a personal diary entry and he sang it to them, about them, for them and with them. They, typically, soon started to sing every word back. What had changed, subtly, was the cool, open air in which the song was allowed to hang, McCann&#8217;s rhythmic delivery in each verse pinned to the bass and drums, saving the collective push for a supercharged chorus. It&#8217;s a progression that remains satisfyingly inside the box.</p>\n<p>Catfish and The Bottlemen went it alone for near to a decade, before their guerrilla tactics (throwing demos on numerous stages and jamming them under car windscreen wipers) and relentless gigging paid off. <em>&#8220;We&#8217;ve still been unsigned for longer than we&#8217;ve been signed,&#8221;</em> says McCann, seemingly never allowing himself to forget the self-initiated activity of their formative years, despite living in the new reality of being a platinum-selling, arena-filling young front man. In person, he&#8217;s a character of kind humility, contrasting the magnetic image of the hip-swinging, black-clad front man that makes thousands of fans sway effortlessly to his every, energetic move. You get the feeling that he&#8217;d do it all again, no matter how long it took, to get Catfish and The Bottlemen to where they are now.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

It comes from a pre-rock era and from there, it proposes a different evolution path for music from the 1950s to present day. Like a different musical development in a parallel timeline.

Since then, the quartet has delivered a string of albums with consistent high quality, always looking for new areas of noise to explore.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Converge released the punishing and (per usual) critically acclaimed album <em>The Dusk in Us All</em>, which in 2018 spawned a follow-up EP, <em>Beautiful Ruin,</em> with extra songs from the same sessions. Each song is a staccato burst of emotion from a Converge at their most raw. Viciously precise yet alluringly out of control. Just as we like it!</p>\n<p>When not making explosions in Converge, their members are skilled players elsewhere in the music biz. Kurt Ballou is one of metal&#8217;s most sought-after studio men, and Jacob Banner has founded Deathwish Inc., one of the most respected and innovative labels for aggressive music (and he does artwork for tons of bands). Nate Newton and Ben Koller lend their skills to other bands. The latter can be experienced twice at Roskilde 2019, with Converge and with The Armed. Crazy drumming galore awaits!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

But what makes the band profoundly exciting, and differentiates them from their peers, is the unmistakable goosebump-inducing magic that bubbles up whenever the duo sings together.</p>\n<p>With inspiration in 90s bands like Throwing Muses and The Breeders, Girlpool found their very own take on this left-of-centre alternative pop and rock music. It can be pretty, but they never pretty up their tunes. They are left standing as raw as they sound right out of the amps. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"er416Ad3R1g\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1665/girlpool_video.jpg\" data-res=\"1316,707\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1665/girlpool_video.jpg?width=1316&amp;height=1316&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>Girlpool first gave sound to the world in 2015. On their debut album <em>Before the World Was Big</em> the duo&#8217;s instrumentation was sparse with just an electric guitar and bass and, of course, the two voices carrying the songs. Girlpool inhabited an entire ecosystem in the space of a bedroom. The duo&#8217;s sophomore album, <em>Powerplant,</em> added a more fully fleshed sound but kept their lullaby-like qualities.</p>\n<p>Girlpool&#8217;s third album is out 1 February. We are promised more signature guitar swells but also &#8220;drum machines and synthesizers and beautiful/new harmonies&#8221;. When you listen to the album&#8217;s first three singles, you can tell that Girlpool has progressed as a band. You will also notice that Cleo Tucker has moved down an octave when singing (<span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0q53Foi79iA\">listen to &#8220;Lucy&#8217;s&#8221;</a></span>). Since the band&#8217;s last album Tucker had begun a non-binary &#8216;gender flow&#8217; which affects the voice, now making it a hearty, wounded baritone.</p>\n<p>When Girlpool plays Roskilde Festival 2019, they will perform as a trio. Definitely something to look forward to!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

In 2008, drummer (and brother of Dimebag) Vinnie Paul died of heart decease.</p>\n<p>After some years with the supergroup Down (and countless other projects), Anselmo started his own band with the backing group The Illegals. Under his own name, Anselmo has released two albums, <em>Walk Through Exits Only </em>(2013) and <em>Choosing Mental Illness As a Virtue</em> (2018). Out grew a bunch of maniacal, genre-defying songs that are as insane as they are enjoyable.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"2-V8kYT1pvE\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1853/philip-h-anselmo-the-illegals-video.jpg\" data-res=\"480,360\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1853/philip-h-anselmo-the-illegals-video.jpg?width=480&amp;height=480&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>Anselmo&#8217;s backing band is beyond skilled musicians, and they help bring their front man&#8217;s musical visions to life with bite and crunch &#8211; and ample doses of insanity.</p>\n<p>So now, after having started 600 bands and always pacing and striving onwards, it&#8217;s time &#8211; for once &#8211; to look back.

That&#8217;s the case for KOPS (civil name Oskar Kops Kronback).

When you listen to his latest single, &#8220;Salvation&#8221;, you first notice the slap bass, the funky vibes and the urges to hit the dancefloor. It&#8217;s a hit all right. It was picked as &#8216;track of the week&#8217; on Danish radio station P3, and it went straight into the charts in all of Scandinavia. Listen closely, and you&#8217;ll notice that KOPS sings &#8220;I&#8217;m so afraid to die alone&#8221;. Happy song on the surface but with a darker depth.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s perhaps the secret recipe behind KOPS&#8217; music, the meeting of light and darkness.</p>\n<p>The Danish producer loves to write songs.

He writes and produces his music single-handedly, and it smells like tomorrow&#8217;s pop music. His Instagram profile reveals sessions with Danish profiles like Phlake, Nonsens and ELOQ so it&#8217;ll be exciting to hear what KOPS has in store for us later on.</p>\n<p>Come catch KOPS on our Countdown stage at Roskilde Festival 2019 before the rest of the world gets to know him.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Through a playful and humorous approach, Anne Duk Hee Jordan illustrates new perspectives on climate change and their tangible effects on the hormones of living organisms by allowing us to experience the world through the eyes of the sealife.

They are collected by smell researcher and artist Sissel Tolaas. Your nose can get closer to a series of surprising smell molecules that Tolaas has collected and recorded over the past 30 years.</p>\n<p>Smeller&#8217;s Corner lets you smell the world and talk about the smells with the people around you.</p>\n<p>Smeller&#8217;s Corner is part of the sense exhibition<em> Sensorium: A Laboratory for the Deceleration of the Body and for a New Politics of the Senses</em>, curated by Solvej Helweg Ovesen and co-produced by the Riga International Biennale of Contemporary Art, 2018. The work is created by Sissel Tolaas, and the walls are designed by Tilman Wendland.</p>\n<p><em>Tolaas was born in Norway in 1963 and has studied chemical science, mathematics, linguistics, languages and visual arts at universities in Olso, Warsaw, Moscow, St. Petersburg and Oxford.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"zpHUc_9pQi4\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/1791/sisseltolaas_thumb.png\" data-res=\"1272,673\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/1791/sisseltolaas_thumb.png?width=1272&amp;height=1272&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n"

Somewhere at the festival you can find the Danish artist S&#248;ren Aagaard&#8217;s land art sculpture <em>Haww&#257;h. </em>The piece consists of a rusty street food truck, halfway submersed in the gravel. Painted over and damaged, with melted plastic furniture and huge piles of seaweed, the truck looks as if it has survived an apocalypse.</p>\n<p>S&#248;ren Aagaard, who is also a trained chef, has worked with food as his subject and material for many years. The culture that surrounds our food can tell us a lot about our society and the time we live in. With <em>Haww&#257;h, </em>S&#248;ren Aagaard focuses on the schism that we want to act responsibly and environmentally friendly, but at the same time we think that we deserve the best. That we want to experience the foreign and exotic, but only on our own turf. Aagaard&#8217;s pieces address the impossibility and extreme complexity of buying and eating ethically &#8211; and at the same time knowing that this is a luxury that not everyone can afford.</p>\n<p>S&#248;ren Aagaard will be exhibiting at the Museum for Contemporary Art in Roskilde city during the festival. In the exhibition, <em>Sommer </em>(Danish for <em>Summer),</em> and during a series of cooking classes that will take place in the exhibition halls, Aagaard will examine key aspects of our relationship with food and art. The exhibition will contain both video pieces, installations and a number of new sculptural pieces.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

He sees urban development as a game of chess. The urban space has a colouring and a rhythm where its architecture sets the pace. In other words, the city invites you to make the next move. And hopefully everything ends well.</p>\n<p>From 1984-1987, ZUSA was a pioneer in wild-style graffiti in Denmark. He has studied graphic design and illustration at the Danish School of Design and made his debut with photo graphics as street art at The Censured Spring Exhibition &#8220;Den Frie&#8221; in 1994.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"
