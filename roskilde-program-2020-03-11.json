It&#8217;s only a matter of seconds in his tracks before he cuts the intro and starts doing his vocal acrobatics. This is an artist with stuff on his mind!</span></p>\n<p>DaBaby, the tough 27-year-old Charlotte rapper, has soared to the centre of the zeitgeist over the course of 2019. He is rap&#8217;s bright star &#8211; one who connects everybody.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4r63FhuTkUYltbVAg5TQnk?si=srlocdIGQGWk_SpeSAycJg\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>He has made a big splash on the back of a bunch of great, high-profile features that he&#8217;s done. Almost every pop-rap hit has gotten the DaBaby touch. In 2019, DaBaby landed on tracks by modern heavyweights such as Chance The Rapper, Lizzo, Lil Nas X and Post Malone.</span></p>\n<p><span>DaBaby has a characteristic sound, and it has made him a star &#8211; and a much sought-after collaborator. He does fleet, two-minute fight songs, raps with a chest-thumping variety &#8211; and, of course, he has a favourite ad-lib (&#8220;vroom!&#8221;) which he generously doses on all his tracks. He&#8217;s renowned for his absurd cockiness &#8211; and his performances and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvuQNNVrbtM\">madcap music videos</a> prove his sharp sense of humour.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"KvuQNNVrbtM\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>You have probably heard his smash hit &#8220;Suge&#8221; taken from his just-as-successful debut album <em>Baby On Baby </em>which he released in early 2019. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, DaBaby served us another album later in 2019, <em>KIRK</em> (sort of self-titled &#8211; he&#8217;s real name: Jonathan Lyndale Kirk), dedicated to his belated father.</span></p>\n<p><span>Prior to that he spat out mixtapes with a furious pace (we&#8217;re counting 13 of them prior to the release of his debut album). DaBaby was also featured in XXL&#8217;s Freshman Class of 2019 (be in there and you&#8217;re almost destined for a break-through). Do check his verses on XXL&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f032Q6cMqco\">cypher</a>. The same lyrics (different beat) feature in the track &#8220;XXL&#8221; that closes <em>KIRK</em>. </span></p>\n<p>This baby has certainly grown, and we&#8217;re looking much forward to welcoming DaBaby to Roskilde Festival 2020.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Pop and modern R&amp;B go hand in hand with groovy beats, lofty feelings and of course Jada&#8217;s fantastic voice.</span></p>\n<p><span>Jada was first spotted in 2018. That was the year she released two singles &#8211; and nothing more. But it was enough to confirm her massive talent. Her Roskilde track record started that same year when she played our Countdown stage (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/CJaUJPWus3U\">watch</a>). She returned in 2019 as part of the main programme where she played for a packed Avalon tent (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA6UFo3xKKk\">watch</a>).

He later developed on his expression, making 2014&#8217;s ferocious <em>Too Bright</em>, and 2016&#8217;s gospel and soul-tinged <em>No Shape</em>. It&#8217;s also worth seeking out some of his cover songs of, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebA6uZeMCzs\">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53us2EAEbm4\">The Grateful Dead</a>.

One thing is releasing tracks and EPs. It&#8217;s a whole other project creating a full album that has is both coherent and has consistent power throughout. AV AV AV succeeded. <em>No Statues</em> contains both lively dynamics, lots of bass, melancholic synths and big beats. It delivers a party soundtrack and soothing sounds for more contemplative moments. Let's call it club poetry.</p>\n<p>In 2020, AV AV AV will enter the Arena stage at Roskilde Festival. Their sound calls for a large enclosed room it can fill up. At the same time, the demand for the Danish trio has only grown and grown. And their live skills have only increasingly gotten sharper and sharper. Most recently, they have done a live fusion with classic instruments together with the symphony orchestra Copenhagen Phil. At Roskilde Festival it will be 100 % AV AV AV, and it is 100 % for sure that you will be dancing when this party machine pushes the power button.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

With six solo albums &#8211; out of which four have hit the #1 spot on the Canadian chart &#8211; and numerous Juno awards and MMVAs, City and Colour is what can be considered a major act. And that&#8217;s not only in Canada. When Green tours around the world, he fills the venues. He has grown fans far and wide with his vulnerable and poignant lyricism about love, life and loss.</span></p>\n<p>City and Colour has also gained layers since the first stripped-bare acoustic albums, resulting in a handful of dreamy, introspective emotional folk-pop releases. Green has once stated that the best music for him is sad music. Listen to any of his songs, and you&#8217;ll find them as evidence of just that.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"uTaTQjgdioo\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>His sixth album, <em>A Pill for Loneliness</em>, came out in 2019. A lush affair full of ethereal synths, textured guitar washes and a sort of orange-hued, melancholic guitar pop that calls for beautiful dreams.</span></p>\n<p><span>When playing live, City and Colour tiptoes between folk and profoundly sad indie rock, and both parts work like a charm. Dallas Green has the kind of clean, relatively high voice that just rings with an ache and beauty that will stun you.</span></p>\n<p>If you want honest, straight-from-the-heart melodic rock music, City and Colour is the band you need to see in concert. Catch them at Roskilde Festival 2020.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

She has been a part of dance and theatrical performances at both the Royal Danish Theatre and Aarhus Teater.</p>\n<p>Look forward to new music, new dance moves and a unique show when Lydmor and Corpus join forces.

Their starting point is semi-arty post-punk, taking on choppy disco rhythms, ambiance, spoken word and shouty songs.

That sweet, goddamn love. Can&#8217;t live with it, can&#8217;t live without it.</span></p>\n<p><span>Just ask Kacey Musgraves.</span></p>\n<p><span>She&#8217;s the big star with all the love songs, growing out of the country capital of Nashville by putting just the right amount of pop inside country and voil&#225;... she&#8217;s a hit!</span></p>\n<p><span>This 31-year-old pop-country artist started playing music in her Texas home at an early age. Her mother took her to local festivals to sing western swing music, and her family funded her first self-released album, <em>Movin&#8217; On</em> (2002). She was just 14 then. To date, she has put out three self-released albums and three studio albums (plus a couple of Christmas releases).</span></p>\n<p><span>Musgraves&#8217; debut major label album, <em>Same Trailer Different Park</em> (2013), made the critics rave, and it climbed to no. 2 on the US album chart (the regular one, not &#8220;just&#8221; the country chart where she went #1). She continued her winning streak with 2015&#8217;s <em>Pageant Material,</em> which was recorded live in the studio. The album ended on numerous end-of-year lists.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/70kkdajctXSbqSMJbQO424?si=wGq73Y1tQ1KcyYXM1Fwn9A\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>But it was thanks to her big breakthrough album <em>Golden Hour</em> (2018) that she managed to put country on the agenda in wider circles of the popular music scene. The album has tunes that sound as if they have been around for years, characterised by crystalline emotional and melodic clarity &#8211; and the subtle flirt with the aesthetics of pop music has helped her ascendance towards the stars.</span></p>\n<p><span>Kacey Musgraves has a gorgeous voice and a vintage model appearance &#8211; but she&#8217;s not your usual Nashville player. Her 2013 single &#8220;Follow Your Arrow&#8221; marked her out as a provocateur of the genre: she advocated kissing girls &#8220;if you want to&#8221;, rolling joints and railed against misogyny. Moreover, she has said about <em>Golden Hour</em> that taking acid helped her make it just right.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"6OFv566mj7s\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>When Musgraves visits Roskilde Festival 2020, she brings a stellar live band with her: drums, pedal steel, cello, double bass, guitars and 70s synthesisers all create a fantastic brew of sound. Her songs translate well to the live stage, and at the centre of it all is her beautiful, crystal-clear vocals. Not to be missed!</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Barker also runs the label Leisure System and has done club night residencies at Berghain for a long stretch.</span></p>\n<p>Look forward to a pulsating (yes, indeed) live set from one of techno&#8217;s biggest genre challengers (and appreciators, too) when Barker plays Roskilde Festival 2020.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Alabama Shakes, who played Roskilde Festival in 2012, was probably one of the best guitar bands to emerge from the US in the past decade. They made two widely acclaimed albums, won lots of awards and played for the Obamas at the White House.</span></p>\n<p><span>Outside the Shakes, Howard has explored more niche interests: an even more garage-punk side-project, Thunderbitch, in 2015, while in 2018 she teamed up with two musicians to form the country-leaning project Bermuda Triangle.</span></p>\n<p>And then came her solo album. <em>Jaime</em> &#8211; named after her sister who died of cancer when Howard was a child &#8211; is something else altogether. She channels D&#8217;Angelo, church organs and themes like tragedy, sexuality, religion, racism and poverty &#8211; all things with which Howard is uncomfortably familiar.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"jKpx4-wlyaQ\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>It&#8217;s a funk-rooted, soulful piece that has won the love of everyone who listened to it. Howard&#8217;s album was included on most best-of-year lists in 2019 &#8211; and it continues to linger as a bold declaration from a restlessly creative artist with plenty on her mind.</span></p>\n<p><span>Her live band is a big one: two keyboard players, two soloing guitarists (besides Howard herself), Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell, backup vocalists and a drummer. Sounds like a terrific approximation of a 60s soul revue band, doesn&#8217;t it? This band brings the funk and bits of psych, equally hard! Just watch the live footage below &#8211; it&#8217;ll make you melt!</span></p>\n<p>Join Brittany Howard for a soul-funk-rooted tour de force when she returns to Roskilde Festival.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Jusk ask MattPike, main man in Oakland&#8217;s metal mongering outfit High On Fire who&#8217;s been making a hell of a racket for 20 ongoing years.</span></p>\n<p><span>Pike first fronted the seminal stoner band Sleep who preferred things slow and psychedelic. In High On Fire, he and his two fellow noise-makers spit out Black Sabbath-style riffing at thrash tempos. </span></p>\n<p><span>High On Fire have proven themselves stalwarts of a sort of classicist heavy metal that can be traced back to genre pioneers like Mot&#246;rhead (one of Pike&#8217;s gods). And High On Fire is indeed one of the most punitive and muscular power trios since late Lemmy&#8217;s band. They have helped bring heavy music into the 21st century via their sonic beatdown of doom and stoner metal (sped up).</span></p>\n<p><span>High On Fire has released eight albums. Their latest, <em>Electric Messiah</em>, came out in 2018. They have been working with Kurt Ballou (Converge guitarist and masterful metal engineer) for the past three albums and he has wrapped them in the right sludgy, powerful sound that their riff-ladden metal needs.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1eiIIImNeUj3vpaocWqoOf?si=n7WzN2KKRE6HXIYhrF0c-Q\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>The band won their first Grammy in 2019 for &#8216;best metal performance&#8217;, beating other mainstream darlings.

Standing amongst a megalithic formation of amplifiers, Matt Pike and bassist Jeff Matz unleash a sonic fury strong enough to rattle the bones of even the most seasoned hesher. The sheer volume alone makes their live shows an experience, and it adds to the band&#8217;s titanic aesthetics.

Something that will make your body move and your head bop along (or spin!). Get a taste of (some of) the sounds of Nyege Nyege Tapes, the celebrated Uganda label focusing on &#8220;outsider music from around the region and beyond&#8221; (their own description).</span></p>\n<p><span>This concert package offers you a double treat: The Ugandan/French duo MC Yallah and Debmaster serves up non-conform hip-hop while Tanzanian duo MCZO &amp; Duke give you a taste of the frantic electronic sound from the streets of Dar Es Salaam.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>MC Yallah &amp; Debmaster</span></strong><span> first got in touch because of some beats Debmaster had sent to Arlen Dilsizian, label boss at Nyege Nyege Tapes. The beats caught the ears of Yallah who quickly decided she wanted to put down a rap on the production. And thus, a duo was formed.</span></p>\n<p>MC Yallah and Debmaster released the debut album <em>Kubali</em> in 2019 through Nyege Nyege Tapes&#8217; sublabel Hakuna Kulala (<span><a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2019/12/19/the-best-albums-of-2019/\">Fact</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/charts/2019-rewind-contributors-charts\">Wire</a> loved it!). It&#8217;s an energetic affair that combines MC Yallah&#8217;s lyrics in Kiswahili and Luganda, Uganda&#8217;s main language, with Debmaster&#8217;s fragmented and detailed productions that stutter, roar and generally makes a lot of noise.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5JEqaMjU6dwGqFJu2wn5Gg?si=6uWb8RFNS6W-A35bgb0bfw\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>The same goes when the duo plays live. Debmaster works his magic as a live producer, and occasionally he whips out a modified PlayStation controller to programme and manipulate drum patterns on the fly. MC Yallah has a stage authority like a skilled player &#8211; which she is, she started at the age of 15.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>MCZO &amp; Duke</span></strong><span> will make your body go into spams. They are exponents of the singeli genre.</span></p>\n<p><span>Singeli is a bracing listen for the uninitiated. It's fast, anywhere between 180 and 300 BPM, placing it well ahead of drum &amp; bass and even some gabber, with MCs rapping over relentless electronic rhythms. It's rowdy and uniquely Tanzanian, informed by decades of the country's electronic and folk music.</span></p>\n<p><span>Duke is one of the key artists from the scene.

The year was 2016.<br/><br/>Just two years later, he was facing his career's greatest challenge: opening the Orange Stage. Not only did SAVEUS' bombastic and soaring electro-pop feel naturally at home on Roskilde Festival&#8217;s main stage.

With inspirations from both house, electro, gospel and pop and with Hedegaard's stunning vocals ranging from the deep to the sky-high falsetto, SAVEUS sent his songs towards the stars. The reviews were positive and the SAVEUS fan club accepted loads of new members.</p>\n<p>Now, new challenges await: The success is to be followed up. Hedegaard has been busy in the practice room, and 2020 will be the year when SAVEUS presents new material. The band is also ready to head back out on the live stages. It is only obvious to invite SAVEUS back to Roskilde Festival for a new triumph.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"GSadpK2ix54\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>It will be with the songbook full of new tunes and with great appetite to knock all music lovers off their feet as they have done twice before.</p>\n<p>Come and be, if not saved, then at least struck by SAVEUS at Roskilde Festival 2020.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Front man, guitarist and main songwriter Gareth Liddiard was part of the band The Drones who released six albums. In 2017, Liddiard and bass player Fiona Kitschin came up with the idea of Tropical Fuck Storm. They haven&#8217;t really looked back since then. </span></p>\n<p><span>Two albums in, Tropical Fuck Storm are one of the most exciting acts out of the land down under.</span></p>\n<p><span>The band&#8217;s nutty, sometimes-atonal-other-times-not brand of bluesy and punkish indie rock hits all the right buttons. Their songs are like apocalyptic odes to a dying planet, and along the way they also deal with social decay, conspiracy theories, mind control and exploitation. All great themes for wacky rock hits.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Braindrops</span></em><span> is the title of their latest album. These drops are sweet, sour and bitter, all at once. Funky ugliness is Tropical Fuck Storms&#8217; modus operandi. Guitars twitch with anxiety, the riffs threaten free jazz skronk but always maintain a traditional sense of groove and structural integrity. Some lines you can sing along to, some rhythms you can dance to. So, even though Tropical Fuck Storm believes we&#8217;re fucked, there's still a skerrick of hope left in their music.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"Rq4NuX7kOLU\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/2908/tropical-fuck-storm-video.jpg\" data-res=\"1280,720\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/2908/tropical-fuck-storm-video.jpg?width=1280&amp;height=1280&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n"

Head over to your streaming service of choice and listen to the recording of it. You can also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX96z7AuICs\">watch a live performance of the piece</a>. One thing is for sure, once you find your way inside the joyous, magical sounds of &#8220;In C&#8221;, you don&#8217;t ever want them to stop again.

His skill set is substantial &#8211; drummer, writer, producer, rapper, singer &#8211; and it&#8217;s a true sign of his standings that Dr. Dre has taken him under his wings and that everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Pusha-T have dedicated time to feature on his songs.</span></p>\n<p><span>33-year-old Anderson .Paak first gained wide recognition in 2016 with the album <em>Malibu</em>, a lush 70s-inflected record about a rapper on the cusp of superstardom. 2018&#8217;s <em>Oxnard</em> was released on Dr. Dre&#8217;s label, Aftermath Entertainment, with Dre as producer &#8211; and it was a sonically diverse, ambitious affair firing on all cylinders.

It has turned many more heads while the band keeps searching for that sweet spot between the highs of dance music and the depths of introspective electronic.</p>\n<p>R&#252;f&#252;s Du Sol delivers a smack-happy bundle of blissful beats, floaty synths and sandy maracas, underpinned by Tyrone Lindqvist&#8217;s hypnotically nonchalant vocals.</p>\n<p>The band played at Roskilde Festival in 2017 (back then they were just called R&#252;f&#252;s), and if you were there, you probably felt the bliss. In 2020, they are back for a late-night party. Working behind drums, keys and guitars, the trio push their songs into a new dimension while they aim to turn our Arena stage into a pumping night club. Melancholy meets bliss, and the feel-good nature of R&#252;f&#252;s Du Sol&#8217;s music will surely have you dancing about.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

No one wanted to release their music back in 1999. What to do, then? You release it yourself. Suspekt started their own label, Tabu Records. It turned out to be a good idea, and Suspekt has stuck to doing things and deciding for themselves ever since.</p>\n<p>Since the very beginning, Suspekt has presented a raw style with hedonistic and explicit songs about sex, drugs and binge drinking and the following comedowns and soul-searchings.</p>\n<p>With their second album, <em>Ingen slukker the stars (&#8216;no one turns off the stars&#8217;),</em> Danish hip-hop sort of lost its virginity to Suspekt. Their expression had become darker, heavier and more serious than before, and the album marked the entry of the dirty boys into Danish rap. That was in 2003. That same year they played their first concert at Roskilde Festival.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"Rq4NuX7kOLU\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/2894/thom-yorke-video.jpg\" data-res=\"1280,720\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/2894/thom-yorke-video.jpg?width=1280&amp;height=1280&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>Orgi-E, Bai-D and Rune Rask had found the right recipe for their music, and they have developed on it over the years. At the same time, they have only become bigger and bigger. Their rowdiness was eagerly welcomed by a young generation, and when the trio's music was suddenly played again and again on daytime radio, their song lyrics were suddenly scrutinised by opinion-makers and accused of one thing and the other.</p>\n<p>Everything remains open for Suspekt. Not least in sound. Their sound can contain everything from gritty guitars, cinematic strings and something completely pared down. Rune Rask is the sound magician who pieces together the music for Orgi-E and Bad-D to rap on top of. This troika still stands strong!</p>\n<p>In February, Suspekt released their long awaited seventh album. It brings more sultry sex rap to the table but it also leaves room for the introspective, existential anguish. The two elements coexist and complement each other.</p>\n<p>It seemed like an obvious choice to invite Suspekt back for another late-night party on the Orange Stage. Time will tell how they plan to go about it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

We first got to know him back in the early 90s as the frontman of the rock band Fielfraz (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=551pOMJox8Q\">watch a Roskilde moment from '92 here</a>) who achieved great success in Denmark.&#160; In 1999, Claus Hempler stepped out on his own, first with a purely jazz-oriented solo debut (<em>Charm School for Pop Singers</em>) and later with a couple of English-language releases with which he positioned himself as Denmark&#8217;s croon man #1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/79tOI0xq2p477VYBgHagHg?si=0Ckg-1P0TPav3yiUmj52BA\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>In 2019, Claus Hempler reinvented himself. He had started writing songs in his Danish mother tongue &#8211; and they sort of poured out of him. He saw it as some kind of mission like in the Fielfraz days when he chased an expression that hadn't been done before. Songwriting had become playful again.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the album <em>Kuffert fuld af mursten </em>(&#8216;suitcase full of bricks&#8217;) was released. It was critically acclaimed by pretty much everyone and ended topping many end-of-year lists.

But this time around there is humour, he taunts himself and reviews his progress in life in poetic phrasings &#8211; and he shoots down the myth of the serious crooner. With brilliant phrasings that savour every syllable, and immaculate melodies, Hempler&#8217;s latest album is extremely successful.</p>\n<p>When Claus Hempler steps on stage, you can look forward to a goosebumping moment <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLgKBSzocE\">in the vein of this performance</a>. The Danish musician will bring his band to Roskilde Festival after a successful spring tour &#8211; so we can look forward to something grand. Claus Hempler is ready for a comeback &#8211; 28 years after he last played at Roskilde Festival.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

DJ Wey, Deejay Xanax, Luis &#8211; and, in this case, DJ Python.

He calls it deep reggaet&#243;n. On top of those rhythms he adds lush, spaced-out sounds with a meditative groove.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"mxvSM5U4cIg\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>The Python sound seeps through a couple of releases.

A full length is expected out in 2020, and you can already now listen to the track house-influenced &#8220;Chalet&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p>DJ Python works out of New York (started in Miami where he first discovered the reggaet&#243;n sound) and he claims that he makes chilled music as an antidote to New York&#8217;s hustle and bustle. His music has the same vibe, overflowing with good ideas but certain in its calmness. Beauty, nostalgia and melancholy go hand in hand in DJ Python&#8217;s sounds.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

They are a Seattle trio who meld jangly shoegaze with noise rock and sludge metal. Soft meets brutal, melodic meets aggressive &#8211; and nothing is contradictionary but complement each other, often within the same song.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/11O8jS9NNmewQkpiGXu0eb?si=lZIThByoR-erirV9I_3t1A\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>The three members of band &#8211; Dana James (bass), Ben Verellen (guitar) and Hozoji Matheson-Margullis (drums) &#8211; take turns at the microphone which allows different dynamics with of male and female vocals (from clarion-clear to bestial might), making the band stand out from the masses of metal bands.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you google the band&#8217;s name you will most likely come across articles about sailing manoeuvres.

Helms Alee are proof that the trio format is a powerful one. They will have you rocking or staring in awe (perhaps both?) when they play Roskilde Festival 2020.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

The album basically imagines the meaning of life in the absence of love.</span></p>\n<p>Sumney wields his voice to let listeners into his mind. It&#8217;s a soulful voice dipping into the register of a whisper to turn intimacy into an option. He threads&#160;<em>Aromanticism</em>&#160;with choir-inspired vocal layering, an effect which is translucent, heart-rending and ethereal. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"-Cq8zRq0G9I\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>Now, he&#8217;s gearing up for his second album. His new album will actually be <em>two</em> albums with a shared title. He calls it <em>grae</em> (phonetical spelling for grey), full of songs about grey areas and in-between spaces. He already has some tunes out, &#8220;Cut Me&#8221; being one of them. His experiments with familiar soul and R&amp;B elements create a sound that seems like it wraps around from 1962 to the distant future.</span></p>\n<p>Moses Sumney&#8217;s blend of electro-soul, bare-bones folk and groove-driven minimalism never fails to impress live. He performs in different constellations. He has played solo, just himself with a guitar and a loop pedal (he can still build a world of sound), and with a three-piece band. You will be treated with the band version when he plays Roskilde Festival. And with two albums out full of new music there will be plenty of opportunities to wallow in Moses Sumney&#8217;s torment. Don&#8217;t worry, though, it will probably help you manage that of your own. His melodramatic music and that incredible voice of his will most likely make your jaw drop a couple of times (try his lovelorn new ballad &#8220;Me in 20 Years&#8221; on for size and imagine it played live).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

But if there&#8217;s one who really stands out, it&#8217;s 25-year-old Tyron Frampton aka Slowthai (he used to slur and mumble so his friends would call him Slow Ty.

His uproarious, hair-raising take on modern Britain has plenty of signposts (The Streets, The Specials, Dizzee Rascal, Slaves), yet feels blazingly original by dint of his irrepressible personality.</span></p>\n<p><span>His rap is uncompromising and cutting. His bars are infused with punk pastiche and poetry, possessing an underlying and ever-present charm.</span></p>\n<p>Since its release there has been considerable excitement around his debut album, <em>Nothing Great About Britain</em> (2019).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"1500:730\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/3276/slowthai.png\" data-res=\"1500,730\" style=\"padding-top:48.66667%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/3276/slowthai.png?width=1500&amp;height=1500&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>The album&#8217;s vision of England is compelling, potent and profoundly grim: divided, wildly unequal, the far right a fact of daily life rather than a fringe.

Everybody wants a piece of Slowthai, and he not only complements all their sounds and voice &#8211; he elevates the songs.</span></p>\n<p><span>And have you seen any live footage from Slowthai concerts? They are wild and rowdy! Along with DJ, producer and MC Kwes Darko, he performs incendiary takes of his tracks, all delivered with a fast-paced, pristine and fervent flow. He whips his crowds into a jumping, moshing, circle-pit-forming frenzy as basslines shake the ground, beats click like snapping bones and electronics spit and gurgle.</span></p>\n<p>Slowthai may offer a middle finger to crumbling modern Britain but he offers a glimmer of hope through his music. Don&#8217;t miss it!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Nevertheless, that&#8217;s the impressive move that Yola &#8211; full name Yola Quartey &#8211; has made over the past couple of years.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"SpotifyModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"SpotifyWrap\">\n<iframe class=\"SpotifyPlayer\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2gqMBdyddvN82dzZt4ZF14?si=UwQ3dXaBQAyQdZOh7sdXxw\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>If there&#8217;s one thing you notice, and fall in love with, instantly, it&#8217;s her voice! The way it fills her debut record, 2019&#8217;s <em>Walk Through Fire</em> &#8211; a buffet of country-soul and break-up songs, backed with fiddle, mandolin, Wurlitzer, and produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys on his own Easy Eye label.</span></p>\n<p><span>It isn&#8217;t just the big, blunt end of Yola&#8217;s powerhouse voice that impresses. Its real magic lies in its depths of emotion and experience, and a dynamic range that can move from comforting whisper to full-on war cry within the space of a couple of lines.</span></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a voice many will have heard without knowing it. Since she was 18, Yola has been lending her vocals and songwriting skills to numerous artists&#8217; tracks, from Katy Perry party songs to Will Young pop ballads and Chase &amp; Status dance tracks; she has toured with Bugz in the Attic and worked with Massive Attack.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"fDhftpjp7WQ\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>When she launched her solo career in 2016 (she moved from England to Nashville), the response was instant: back-to-back honours in the Americana Music Association awards, and a warm welcome to Nashville, a city that has embraced her music so quickly that it has become her second home away from Bristol. Besides getting to work with Dan Auerbach she became a honourary member of Brandi Carlile&#8217;s The Highwomen supergroup.</span></p>\n<p><span>Straddling vintage country, orchestral pop and classic soul, Yola expresses an affinity for retro sounds while managing to remain free of cloying imitation or forced pastiche. She has been compared to the likes of Dusty Springfield and Sandie Shaw.</span></p>\n<p>Scroll through Youtube (for instance, look <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hz65oGIra0\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCCV8sEKfiQ\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoMpVYPIRGc\">here</a>) and you&#8217;ll quickly find that Yola is just an amazing singer live as she is on record. Her melodic, resonant singing is so sweeping in scope it can bear hug everything within reach. Her sweet tunes are delivered by an exceptional backing band &#8211; so expect a concert full of great emotions when Yola performs at Roskilde Festival.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

It has won Helmig not only numerous chart-toppers &#8211; and simultaneously loads of music awards &#8211; but also the hearts of many music lovers.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&#160;</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Thomas Helmig has won honorary awards, written a&#160;</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5bF5AW5fYg\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">football world cup song</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, made film soundtracks and musicals.

The album went straight to no. 1 on the British chart, the critics love it (<a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/music/psychodrama/dave\">just look here</a>) and Dave went on to win the much esteemed Mercury Music Prize. </span></p>\n<p>On <em>Psychodrama</em>&#160;Dave brings us into his therapy room while he grapples with societal injustice, industry contradictions and private pain.&#160;The album&#8217;s sound is spare and sullen, its beats lightly decorated with moody piano figures and ghostly snatches of warped vocals, its tone unsparingly downbeat and sombre.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"JpGKWUdRnXE\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>Like Stormzy before him, Dave&#8217;s gift is to take an awkward kid&#8217;s view of his London postcode and make its struggles universal, through storytelling, flaming wordplay and pugnacious production. That he has done so outside the major-label system says something about the quality of his output. Stormzy is, of course, a fan and appears in the video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUPSNdmFew\">&#8220;Black&#8221;</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Where the album is bleakly beautiful, Dave&#8217;s live experience is more of an emotionally driven party.&#160;When you witness thousands of voices rapping along to &#8220;Streatham&#8221;, a song about a traumatic youth, you&#8217;re in for a mass catharsis. He also has some true party bangers in his bag, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpGKWUdRnXE\">&#8220;Location&#8221;</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jtl1fTccqs\">&#8220;No Words&#8221;</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxns_n9q0f4\">&#8220;Funky Friday&#8221;</a>.</span></p>\n<p>Catch the perfect emotional rollercoaster in the company of one of the most promising rappers in the game.

We're back in 1998 when the trio played their debut concert here. It was the same year that they released their debut record, <em>Smash Hit in Aberdeen </em>(it was a smash hit in Denmark!).

Danish rap in the 90s was busy imitating the Americans. In some way, it still does. Malk De Koijn had completely different ideas and approaches. They were like someone who had observed hip-hop from another planet &#8211; yet they had full control of all means, references, history &#8211; and, of course, stage presence!</p>\n<p>Their rhythmic backdrop has always aimed for a classic sound. But the topsy-turvy, raving rap on top of it all has always been in a league of its own, allowing the imaginative, the funny and the profound to naturally co-exist in their DNA.</p>\n<p>It's been nine years since Malk De Koijn last returned. Now, they're going to do it again.</p>\n<p>Because of many other projects the members are engaged in, it&#8217;s a rare sight to see Malk De Koijn together on stage. This will be the only chance to catch them at a festival in 2020.</p>\n<p>Look forward to (yet) a visit to the mythical Langestrand (&#8216;longbeach&#8217;) together with Malk De Koijn when they start up a late party at Roskilde Festival 2020.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Anyone who&#8217;s seen her live can attest to her dynamism onstage. Rico&#8217;s energy is contagious, and her concerts feel like one giant moshpit.

They were released on Alan McGee&#8217;s famed indie label, Creation Records.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, Ride were always reluctant to hang their hat on the shoegaze tag and changed musical direction with the 1994 album&#160;<em>Carnival of Light,</em>&#160;opting for a more classic rock sound. They lost the fans, the adoration of the music press and, before long, themselves, when Andy Bell and Mark Gardener decided to split up the band in 1996.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"3cN0vWnVaHU\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>But you can&#8217;t keep a good band down, and in 2014 the stars realigned.

And 2019 saw another album, <em>This Is Not a Safe Place</em>, which was perhaps one step above its predecessor.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ride is the band that every budding indie guitarist wanted to be in growing up. Admired by fans and fellow musicians alike, their recent performances reveal why their music &#8211; and indeed musicianship &#8211; has endured over the past 30 years.</span></p>\n<p>This Ride&#8217;s far from over.

He has four platinum singles to his own name plus he features on a chart-topping single (Camila Cabello&#8217;s &#8220;Havana&#8221;). He&#8217;s also become one of hip-hop&#8217;s biggest fashion icons.&#160;</span><span>The 28-year-old rapper from Atlanta&#8217;s Jonesboro South projects also attracted attention for his contributions as a songwriter and backup vocalist on Childish Gambino&#8217;s &#8220;This is America&#8221;.</span></p>\n<p><span>All this before dropping his debut album. But then again, the concept of the debut album is pretty muddled in contemporary hip-hop.</span></p>\n<p><span>Nevertheless, 2019 was the year when Young Thug did release his first album proper.

He has the skills to squeeze a colony of words into&#160; a tiny bit of space, and he&#8217;s the king of ad-libs!</span></p>\n<p><span>Young Thug is keen on pacing things up with rolling volleys of hi-hats, shattering bass, synth-y textures and general bizarreness. He&#8217;s a freewheeling surrealist who continues the Weird Atlanta tradition of artists like Andr&#233; 3000, Janelle Mon&#225;e and Cee Lo Green.</span></p>\n<p><span>Young Thug demands the party when he plays live. We saw that the last time he played Roskilde Festival (2016). His songs prompt singalongs and calls for mosh pits as he assumes a rockstar demeanour bouncing across the stage. </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media video youtube\" data-trackid=\"leJNDpm_G10\" data-ui=\"true\" data-aspect=\"16/9\" data-size=\"cover\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"/>\n</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"TextModule\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p><span>Expect the energy levels to rise all over when Thugger takes the stage at Roskilde Festival 2020.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

It&#8217;s easy to dance to and has an intriguing connection to the taranta dances that can supposedly cure tarantula bites.</span></p>\n<p><span>CGS was formed in 1975 as a seven-piece band and a dancer. Band leader back then was Rina Murante who handed down the leadership to his son, fiddler and drummer Mauro Durante, in 2007.</span></p>\n<p>The group&#8217;s quest is &#8211; and has always been &#8211; to merge the folk traditions with western pop trends.

In front you&#8217;ll see dancer Silvia Perrone&#8217;s stylish visual accompaniment to the musical material.</span></p>\n<p><span>The nature of&#160;pizzica<em>&#160;</em>is its almost complete lack of harmonic shift. It is not unusual for almost an entire piece to be based on a single drone note, which just occasionally shifts, only to return to its anchoring position. That way, the music can easily whirl you into a trance.</span></p>\n<p>CGS has performed all over the world, including shows in London&#8217;s Royal Albert Hall.

So, Bagge, who had just built and improvised live, had to find a way to reconstruct his magic. In 2006, he released his first EP, <em>Ingen tak til systemet</em> (&#8216;no thanks to the system&#8217;) on Echoterm (since re-released on Kul&#248;r).

His works are shaping surprising mediations on human existence and the invisible structures of everyday life.</p>\n<p>For Roskilde Festival 2020, Martin Creed has created a monumental sculpture in the form of an enormous revolving sign with the word &#8216;Understanding&#8217; in red neon. It was originally conceived as part of a three-part piece, &#8220;Peace, Love and Understanding&#8221;, but finally realised as one huge, spinning neon sign.</p>\n<p>The piece can be viewed as a beacon of hope and dreams in a society where mutual understanding is a driving force. The work evokes an idea of a modern utopia. At the same time, the sculpture will have a great visual impact while functioning as a central meeting point at the festival due to its visibility and presence at the festival main area.</p>\n<p>Martin Creed (b. 1968) is a British artist who lives and works in London. He graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art at University College London in 1990, and in 2001 he was awarded the prestigious Turner Prize with <em>Work No. 227: The lights going on and off</em>. His works include both films, installations, paintings, theatre and live-action sculptures.</p>\n<p><em>The project is curated by Creator Projects for Roskilde Festival Art and Activism 2020. </em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"MediaModule\"><div class=\"inner\"><div class=\"media-con\"><div class=\"media image\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"\" data-aspect=\"1200:670\" data-focal=\"0.5,0.5\" data-crop=\"true\" data-size=\"cover\" data-url=\"/media/3127/martin-creed-understanding.jpg\" data-res=\"1200,670\" style=\"padding-top:55.83333%;\"><noscript><img src=\"/media/3127/martin-creed-understanding.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;center=0.5,0.5&amp;mode=crop&amp;cropmode=percentage\" alt=\"\"/></noscript></div>\n</div><div class=\"copy-con\"><p style=\"font-size: 9px;\">&#169; Martin Creed.
